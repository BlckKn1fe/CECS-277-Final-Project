## Description

The Elevator Simulation project was my final project in CECS 277, and it incorporated a lot of object-oriented programming concepts. It also introduces various design patterns such as Strategy pattern, Abstract Factory pattern, Observer pattern, State pattern, and so on.

The Project is about 95% complete. Although it may still have some potential bugs that have not been discovered, it is a very good example of object-oriented development. I learned a very rich and solid object-oriented development related content in CECS 277. Practicing on Final Project has given me a deeper understanding of object-oriented development.
